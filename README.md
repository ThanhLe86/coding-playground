Code for learning VGU Data Structure and Algorithm course (recorded from 21st April 2024)
## Progress:
    - Learned to code in Java
    - Implemented Mergesort, Insertion sort, Quicksort algorithms
    - Learned doubly linked list, stack, queue
    - Trees data structure and binary tree 
    - Relooked at how to use gitbash

## Progress;
    - Fixed README file format
    - Learned how to implement a Queue with two Stacks: There are two methods, the second is implemented in this code due to superior time complexity. The following website is only used as reference when necessary, none of the code inside was used for my implementation.

    **Caveat**: QueuewithStacks code is still incomplete and untested.
